#### By _**Kimberly Bordon**_

## Description

_This is a brief survey to help potential students determine the programming language that suit them. It will take a user's name, and then have them answer questions. Using branching and JavaScript, it will display one of five programming language, or failing to choose one, will encourage the user to try again. A preview of this survey can be seen at [here](https://kbordon.github.io/track-suggester) or copy this url "https://kbordon.github.io/track-suggester"._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Using terminal or favorite shell, clone the repository.
  * Or you can use a browser to download the .zip file from the Github web interface.
* With either shell or browser, navigate to track-suggester folder.
* Open the index.html file with your browser.
* Follow page as per instruction to answer form.

## Known Bugs

Not really a bug so much as a aesthetic choice. Refrain from viewing through large viewport to avoid giant negative spaces. If using a large desktop, for example, it is best to shrink browser window size for optimal viewing.

## Future Plans

* Add more input fields to get user's contact information.
